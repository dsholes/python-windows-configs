After installing Miniconda, JupyterLab, VSCodium and Git, make sure to
copy these config files.

Jupyter Lab:
- `jupyter_notebook_config.py` should be copied to `C:\Users\user\.jupyter`

VSCodium:
- `settings.json` should be copied to `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\VSCodium\User`
- Follow instructions in `extensions.list` to install all extensions

Consider switching to VSCode to use Settings Sync. Right now it's broken in VSCodium
